# Browser Telephone

Ever wondered why we're in the year 2015 and you still can't use your browser to make a phone call to your grandmother while you browse Reddit for lolcats? Well, good news is that you actually can!

## The Problem

Browser telephony is at the core of our business, being we provide a browser based call centre and all. Turns out that the network piping and details — while not the simplest thing ever — are already handled by our provider, so all that's left to worry about is how to implement the most excellent browser phone ever known to Mankind.

It may be a browser extension, or something in a web page — basically very idea is fair game, as long as it is browser based, and doesn't need external plug-ins or applications.

We prize:

* Convenience
* Aesthetics
* Performance
* Extra functionality (think about what your smartphone does)
* Code technique, cleanness, maintainability and architecture
* Your own special personal touch

## Background Information

Twilio provides a javascript WebRTC client that allows you to send and receive sound over the internet. In layman's terms, what this means is that after downloading Twilio's javascript lib, you'll have access to a javascript API that will allow you to actually make phone calls from a reasonably recent browser.

We'll set you up with an account and guide you around the API for the basics, along with common pitfalls we faced when building our product, but the rest is up to you!

Good luck, and call me maybe!

*Final note*: If there's anything you don't understand or is ambiguous, open an issue in your repository with the question ;)
