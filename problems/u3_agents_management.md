## Agents Management

Talkdesk has a main product section that agregates every account Agents information. In this section the account Admin can create a new Agent or edit an existing Agent meta information. This meta information is crucial to user management because the way it's configured influences all the Call Center behaviour.
	
Typically, a big company has a lot ot Agents, an ammount that can reach more than a hundred. With this number of Agents, the way Agents meta information is managed is vital for two of the products main value propositions, usability and scalability.
	
The focus of this challenge is to access not only interface design skills but the way big data management is thinked and the consequent paradigms on interaction design.
	
The assets for this challenge are a persona that hypothetically represents and caracterize one segment of our clients and user stories to be used as common thread to create the experience.

User Stories	
	
- As Lee Morgan, I want to be able to scope Agents list in order to view only Agents with the Role Sales Enterprise.

- As Lee Morgan, I want to be able to find an Agent by its Name in order to add him the New York Ring Group.  

- As Lee Morgan, I want to be able to update agents meta information in bulk in order to assign multiple users to a Ring Group in one page.

- As Lee Morgan, I want to be able to view a list of agents from a preset in order to assign them to a Role based on a previous filter by Ring Group in one page.

Interface Considerations:

1) Each Agent has:

	- Name (Agent's name and E-mail)
	- Type (Full Agent or Flex Agent)
	- Role (e.g: Sales VIP, Advanced Agent, Support) [Single]
	- Ring Group (e.g: agents, first-line, bugs) [Multiple]

2) The interface renders 25 Agents per page and has pagination

3) After search or filter the interface renders all Agents in one page

Using the background information we provide in the following section and taking into consideration the points mentioned above, please present us with a process and a methodology for an approach to solve this challenge. You may want to consider some deliverables like: task-flow analysis diagrams, interactive rapid prototypes, visual translation (hi-fidelity mockups) and the html/css for the interfaces.
