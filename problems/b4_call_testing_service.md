# Call Testing Service

Have you ever used Skype? You likely did, hence you also likely tried its call testing service.

For you, alien, who never used Skype, a call testing service is a number you dial, are asked to leave a message, and that message will be repeated to you, allowing you to check if your microphone and speakers are properly setup. In other words, it's an echo service.

For this challenge we want you to implement a call testing service that will allow Talkdesk users to test their sound setup.

## The Problem

At Talkdesk, we use [Twilio](http://twilio.com) as one of our telecomunications provider. Twilio enables developers to interact with typical telecomunications systems - such as voice, SMS and MMS - controlling interactions through something that is known to all of us: the HTTP protocol. You can learn about how to use Twilio by following [this tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/ruby/twiml).

Crazy cool ideas include localization (e.g., greet with 'Ol√°!' if the caller has Portuguese phone number) and doing a white-list filter, only accepting calls from Talkdesk numbers.

*Final note*: If there's anything you don't understand or is ambiguous, open an issue in your repository with the question ;)
